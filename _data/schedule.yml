    Lambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does 'lambda' mean what
    C#, Java, Python, C++, etc. mean by 'lambda'? Where did lambdas come from?
    What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data
    abstraction?

    In this session we will look into the history, the syntax and the uses of
    lambdas and the way in which lambda constructs in various languages do (or
    do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus.
