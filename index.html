        <h2>About the conference</h2>
        <p><strong>Beauty in Code</strong> is a single-track IT conference at
          Malmö Live, Sweden. Every year in March we gather six amazing
          speakers that are bringing new exciting material for a full day of
        learning.</p>
        <p>Our idea is to create a conference for everyone involved in the
          software industry. We put it on a Saturday so no-one gets denied due
          to work. We keep the fee very low so everyone can afford to attend.
        In fact, you only pay for the lunch and fika; the actual conference is
        on us, because we love to share knowledge and this is our way of giving
      back to the community.</p>
        <p>We wish you welcome to an inspiring day at Malmö Live.</p>
